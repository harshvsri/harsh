          </h2>
          <p>
            👋 Hi there! I'm Harsh, a student web developer who's passionate
            about crafting engaging and dynamic web experiences. <br />
            <br />
            🎓 I'm currently pursuing bachelors in Computer Science and
            Engineering and honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other
            web technologies. <br /> I love learning new things and
            experimenting with cutting-edge tools and frameworks to create
            modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites.
            <br />
            <br />
            💻 In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal projects,
            contributing to open-source software, and collaborating with fellow
            developers to solve challenging problems. <br /> I'm always looking
            for opportunities to apply my knowledge and expand my skill set.
            <br />
            <br />
            🌟 My goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer and make a
            positive impact on the web development community. <br /> If you'd
            like to connect with me or learn more about my work, feel free to
            reach out.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thanks for stopping by! 😄
