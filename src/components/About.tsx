          <p>
            Hi there! I'm Harsh, a student web developer who's passionate about
            crafting engaging and dynamic web experiences. <br />
            <br />
            I'm currently pursuing bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering
            and honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web
            technologies. <br /> I love learning new things and experimenting
            with cutting-edge tools and frameworks to create modern, responsive,
            and user-friendly websites.
            <br />
            <br />
            In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal projects, contributing
            to open-source software, and collaborating with fellow developers to
            solve challenging problems. <br /> I'm always looking for
            opportunities to apply my knowledge and expand my skill set.
            <br />
            <br />
            My goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer and make a
            positive impact on the web development community. <br /> If you'd
            like to connect with me or learn more about my work, feel free to
            reach out.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thanks for stopping by!
